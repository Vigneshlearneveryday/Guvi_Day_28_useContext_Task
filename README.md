## Lessons Learned

Through this task I learned why we use Context API and how to use context API.

<b>Why we use Context API</b>: 
- Global State Management
- Avoid Prop Drilling
- Performance Optimization
  
<b>Usage</b>: 
- <b>createContext()</b>:
	- A context is created using the createContext function. It returns an object with a Provider and a Consumer
- <b>Provider</b>:
  - The Provider component is responsible for providing the context value to its children. It takes a value property, which is the data you want to share.
- <b>useContext ()</b>:
	- It is used to consume a React context within a functional component.
